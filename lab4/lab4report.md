# Lab 4

This lab report will detail my process of completing a task where I use `vim` and `git` command line tools to edit a bug within a clone of a forked repository before pushing the changes back to my Github account. The clone of the forked repository exists on the server `arobertson@ieng6.ucsd.edu`. 

## Logging into ieng6
## Cloning my fork of the repository 
## Running the tests (should fail)
## Editing the code file to fix the failing test
## Running the tests (should succeed)
## Committing and pushing the change to my Github account
