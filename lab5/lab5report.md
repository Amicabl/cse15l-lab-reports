# Lab 5 Report

This lab report will detail a debugging scenario I have created from a subset of the files provided during the Week 4 Lab on Testing. To add more of my own creativity, I have modified the provided `LinkedListExample.java` file by first fixing the original bug and then creating a `main` method. My strategy for this lab report was to code a `bash` file that would perform a function related to Linked Lists and keep working until I encountered an interesting bug.
